Movies, however, have begun to move away from the forefront of popular culture over the previous ten years. Although overall domestic box office results continued to rise after the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of tickets sold has been declining since 2000. And as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hollywood's annual gross fell from \$11.36 billion in 2019 to \$2.11 billion in 2020. All media is now digital media, as all aspects of the media industry have gone through a rapid phase of digitization to keep up with shifting audience attention. While one can easily watch movies in an on-demand fashion via streaming channels, the movies that typically drive the cultural conversation du jour are usually the new releases that are only available in theaters. This is confirmed in various situations in this dashboard, as The market was easily influenced by a single big production movie in 2023 and conflicted with the number of releases and total grosses in 2022. In the digital age of instant access and information overload, the windowed release of movies actively works against todayâ€™s consumer preferences and the cultural reach of movies. This showed how the IMAX genre sold considerably more despite its low number of releases compared to other genres. Around 70% of successful movie revenues come from foreign sales, showing that focusing on domestic gross is not sustainable any more.
