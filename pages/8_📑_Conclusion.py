For the past ten years, movies have started to recede from the foreground of popular culture, and the number of tickets sold has been declining since 2000. And as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hollywood's annual gross fell from \$11.36 billion in 2019 to \$2.11 billion in 2020. However, overall domestic box office results continued to rise after the COVID-19 pandemic.Â    
Â All media is now digital media, as all aspects of the media industry have gone through a rapid phase of digitization to keep up with shifting audience attention. While one can easily watch movies in an on-demand fashion via streaming channels, the movies that typically drive the cultural conversation du jour are usually the new releases that are only available in theaters. This is supported by a number of instances on this dashboard. For instance, the market in 2023 was readily swayed by a single big-budget film, which was responsible for more than 85% of total revenue, and there was also a contradict between the number of movies and total gross revenue in Fall 2022. In the digital age of instant access and information overload, the way movies are released in "windows" goes against what people want and how movies affect culture.This is supported by the fact that, although having fewer releases than other genres, the IMAX (high-tech features) genre sold significantly more tickets. Moreover, the fact that around 70% of successful movies income comes from overseas sales demonstrates that relying only on domestic gross is no longer sustainable.
