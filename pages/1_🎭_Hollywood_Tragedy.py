st.write(""" ### Gross Box Office Revenue Concept ##  """)

st.write("""
 The revenue generated from ticket sales (receipts), including any taxes and other levies, is referred to as the gross box office.[[4]](http://uis.unesco.org/en/glossary-term/gross-box-office)  The information on grosses exclusively applies to theatrical receipts in this dashboard; it does not include DVD/Blu-ray sales or digital platform income. The distinction between net and gross box office revenue is substantial. While the money collected from the total sale of movie tickets is included in the gross box office collection, the term "net" refers to the gross box office collection less government deductions such as entertainment tax, service tax, etc. In this dashboard, we discussed the Hollywood movie industry's gross profit.

st.write(""" ## Hollywood Industry Yearly Gross Revenue """)

st.write("""  From \$7.47 billion in 2000 to \$11.36 billion in 2019, Hollywood has seen a steady rise in its overall revenue. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which closed all of the world's teather doors, this trend came to an abrupt end in 2020 with a drop to 2.11B. Since December 2020, when vaccination became available, this figure has steadily increased, reaching nearly 4.5 billion in 2021 (a more than 112% increase). This upward trend persisted into 2022, but not by enough to surpass the high of 11.3B in 2019.
