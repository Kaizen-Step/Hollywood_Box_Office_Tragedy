As we saw in the previous section, Box office gross income in 2022 was \$7.3 billion, and gross income in 2023 has so far reached 1.06 billion in less than two months. Is this anticipation accurate? Let's dive in the daily and weekly figures for 2023 to find out.

st.write(""" As expected, there were significant differences between the weekend's top 10 gross and other days of the week.The first two months of 2023 saw an average daily top-ten movie gross of \$17.65 million; in comparison, the same period in 2019 saw an average daily top-ten movie gross of \$20.37 million. While "Avatar: The Way of Water" accounted for the majority of the first month's gross with \$665.88 million, "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania" created a hype in the second month weekend, and the market hit a record of \$54.71 million in one day, with "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania" accounting for \$46.5 million (85% of the day total) of this. The overall view of the 2023 daily charts revealed that the market was easily influenced by a single big production movie. And this is made much more intriguing by the knowledge that every day, more than 30 movies were released.
