st.write(""" ### MPA Rating Concept ##  """)

st.write("""
The Motion Picture Association film rating system is used in the United States and its territories to rate a motion picture's suitability for certain audiences based on its content. The system and the ratings applied to individual motion pictures are the responsibility of the Motion Picture Association (MPA). Introduced in 1968, following the Hays Code of the classical Hollywood cinema era, the MPA rating system is one of various motion picture rating systems that are used to help parents decide what films are appropriate for their children. It is administered by the Classification & Ratings Administration (CARA), an independent division of the MPA. The MPA film ratings are as follows: 
* G â€“ (General Audiences) All ages admitted. Nothing that would offend parents for viewing by children
* PG â€“ (Parental Guidance Suggested) Some material may not be suitable for children. Parents urged to give "parental guidance"  
* PG-13 â€“ (Parents Strongly Cautioned) Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13, Parents are urged to be cautious    
* R â€“ (Restricted) Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian. Contains some adult material   
* NC-17 â€“ (Adults Only) No one 17 and under admitted. Clearly adult. Children are not admitted  [[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system)    

In this dashboard, we do not include NC-17 rating as a separate rating and blend this rating with R rating as one category.
