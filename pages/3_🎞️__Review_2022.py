This trend was expected to continue, and the record should have been broken in 2022. However, as you can see, there were days with a maximum of 99 million top ten grossings, and none of them were able to break "Spider-Man: No Way Home's" record in 2021. In 2022, there were seven days with more than 50 million top ten grossings, with other days tolerated between 20m and 45m on weekends and 2m to 14m on weekdays.

The Qatar 2022 World Cup might be a reason for this fall. Even though the number of movies that came out during this time period went down, the total gross didn't change much. Maybe theaters showing soccer matches were the reason for this.
